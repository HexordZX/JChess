 - I was able to handle abstract classes, polymorphism, and casting and understand how they are used.
 - I learned design patterns such as Singleton and Builders.
 - I learned how to make simple unit tests to test program functions.
 - I learned how to make an AI with a Minimax model with alpha-beta pruning.
 - I improved my skills in debugging and interpreting errors.
## TODO
